Based on my analysis of the frontend codebase, I'll create a comprehensive backend development plan. Let me break this down into the requested sections:
Data Models Needed
Apply to Readmebacken...
Database Schema with Relationships
Apply to Readmebacken...
API Endpoints Required
Apply to Readmebacken...
Optimal File Structure for app/api/
Apply to Readmebacken...
Integration Points with Existing Frontend Components
Dashboard Integration
Connect to /api/analytics/overview for statistics
Use /api/interviews/upcoming for upcoming interviews
Implement /api/candidates/search for quick search
Candidates Module Integration
Integrate with /api/candidates for CRUD operations
Use /api/candidates/search for filtering and search
Connect to /api/candidates/:id/resume for resume management
Interviews Module Integration
Connect to /api/interviews for scheduling
Use /api/interviews/calendar for calendar view
Implement /api/interviews/:id/status for status updates
Integrate with /api/interviews/:id/feedback for feedback
Email Module Integration
Connect to /api/emails/templates for template management
Use /api/emails/send for sending emails
Implement /api/emails/history for tracking
Integrate with /api/emails/status/:id for delivery status
Analytics Module Integration
Connect to all /api/analytics/* endpoints
Implement real-time updates using WebSocket
Use data for charts and statistics
This backend development plan provides a solid foundation for implementing the required functionality while maintaining consistency with the existing frontend codebase. The structure follows Next.js 13+ API routes conventions and includes TypeScript types for better type safety and development experience.
